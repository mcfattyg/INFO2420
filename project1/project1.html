<h2>Website - Jami Lin</h2>
<a href="https://www.jamilin.com">www.jamilin.com</a>

<li>My first impression of this site is that it is pretty ugly, mostly because the first and biggest thing you see is an image that has been enlarged causing it to look really bad.</li>
<li>The site’s information is arranged with several links that are listed in the middle of the page laying side by side with just a name. There are 7 links at the top and 4 of them got added again below with added images (that look bad) and some more text below the images explaining what is in the link.</li>
<li>The structure seems a little off. The footer is below the first set of links and not at the bottom where it belongs. I think the links should be arranged in a better way.</li>
<li>The graphics are very distracting.  The main banner is too small, and the site is blowing it up to fit the screen and it makes the images and text look pixelated.  There isn’t a consistency with the other graphics.  One has a circle image border, and the others are just poorly cut out and placed on a white background.</li>
<li>The site loaded extremely fast.</li>
<li>The color was fine but the text in the 7 links in the middle of the page is a little small and hard to read.</li>
<li> I guess the 7 links in the middle of the page could be a navigation tool.  If it is, it should probably be at the top of the page.  Navigation is basic.  Clicking a link sends you to other pages and you need to hit the back button to return to the homepage. Users could get lost if they get too deep into the site.</li>
<li>There is no consistency with this site.  Each page has a different look and feel.</li> 
<li>The site does adjust well to smaller window sizes, and I thought it would look better on my phone.  When I tried to look at it on my phone it told me to turn my phone sideways and my best experience would be on a larger screen. The phone looked mostly fine.  Some of the text did have awkward returns in them.</li>
<li>The site reminds me of what the web looked like when I first got onto the internet around 1999.  There is text on the site that says it was last updated today (May 27,2005) but the site looks very dated and some of the individual pages remind me of the early days of MySpace.  The site needs a major update.</li>
